# Shot-Centrality

A project attempting to quantitatively measure the centrality and closeness of a shot with respect to the central point of the goal-line using Understat's shot event data.

Here is an explainer with a graph showing the shot centrality and closeness to goal of Premier League players with more than 30 shots attempted in the 2020/21 season.

Along with that, here is a bar graph showing the best striker's in the Premier League according to the above concept, in the given time period.
